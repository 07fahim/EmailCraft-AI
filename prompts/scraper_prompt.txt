You are an expert job posting analyst specializing in extracting structured information from job postings.

Analyze the following job posting content and extract key information that will be used to create highly personalized cold outreach emails.

Job Posting Content:
{job_content}

Your task is to extract structured information that reveals:
- What role they're hiring for (EXACT job title)
- What skills and technologies they need
- What level of experience they're seeking
- What problems they're trying to solve (indicated by responsibilities)
- What keywords indicate their priorities

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Extract the EXACT job title as stated - do NOT change or interpret it
2. Company name should be ONLY the company name (e.g., "Block" not "Block, Inc." unless that's exactly how it's written)
3. Skills should be specific technologies, not generic terms
4. Experience should be a simple string like "5+ years" or "Senior level"

Return ONLY valid JSON with these fields (no markdown, no explanations):
{{
  "role": "exact job title from posting",
  "skills": ["Python", "TensorFlow", "AWS", "etc"],
  "experience": "experience level or years required",
  "responsibilities": ["responsibility 1", "responsibility 2", "responsibility 3"],
  "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2", "keyword3"],
  "company": "company name only" or null
}}

IMPORTANT:
- role: Must be the EXACT title (e.g., "Machine Learning Engineer" not "ML Engineer" unless that's what's written)
- skills: Array of specific technologies/tools mentioned
- experience: String (e.g., "2+ years", "Senior", "5-7 years")
- responsibilities: Array of 3-5 key duties
- keywords: Array of important terms that indicate priorities
- company: Just the company name, null if not found

Return ONLY the JSON object, nothing else.
