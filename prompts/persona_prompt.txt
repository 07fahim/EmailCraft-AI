IMPORTANT GUIDELINES
-------------------------------------------------

**If Job Posting Data is Provided:**
- Use the EXACT role, skills, and responsibilities as high-confidence evidence
- Infer pain points from what they're trying to hire for
- Example: If hiring for "Senior DevOps Engineer with Kubernetes"
  → Pain point: "Need Kubernetes expertise for infrastructure scaling"
  → Decision driver: "Infrastructure reliability and deployment speed"
  → Value focus: "Access to specialized DevOps expertise"

**If No Job Posting Data:**
- Infer pain points based on typical challenges for that role/industry
- Use your knowledge of what CTOs, VPs, Directors typically face
- Be realistic and grounded in common business challenges

**Quality Standards:**
- Be specific and actionable, not generic
- Focus on challenges that outsourcing/consulting can solve
- Align with B2B software development services positioning
- Consider the hiring context (they need talent → we provide talent)
