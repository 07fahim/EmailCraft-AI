### Adding Templates

**See the complete guide:** [Custom Templates Guide](CUSTOM_TEMPLATES_GUIDE.md)

**Quick Steps:**

1. Open template file: `data/email_templates.json`

2. Add your template:

   ```json
   {
     "id": "my_template_1",
     "title": "My Custom Template",
     "industry": "Technology",
     "use_case": "Product demo",
     "subject_line": "Subject with {placeholders}",
     "body": "Email body...",
     "cta": "Book a call",
     "performance_score": 8.0
   }
   ```

3. Restart application

## Portfolio Management

Manage your portfolio items for automatic inclusion in emails.

### What is Portfolio Matching?

The system automatically:

1. Analyzes job requirements
2. Searches your portfolio
3. Includes relevant projects in emails

### Adding Portfolio Items

**Edit portfolio file:** `data/portfolio.json`

**Or use CSV:** `data/my_portfolio.csv`

### Portfolio Structure

```json
{
  "title": "E-commerce Platform",
  "description": "Built scalable platform handling 1M+ users",
  "tech_stack": "React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, AWS",
  "link": "https://github.com/username/project",
  "category": "Web Development"
}
```

### How Matching Works

**Example:**

Job requires: `React, Node.js, AWS`

Your portfolio:

- ✅ "E-commerce Platform" (React, Node.js, AWS) - **Matched!**
- ❌ "Mobile App" (Flutter, Firebase) - Not matched
- ✅ "API Service" (Node.js, AWS) - **Matched!**

**Result:** Top 2 matched projects included in email

### Quality Score Guidelines

| Score   | Quality   | Action          |
| ------- | --------- | --------------- |
| 9-10    | Excellent | Send as-is      |
| 7-8.9   | Good      | Minor tweaks    |
| 5-6.9   | Fair      | Review and edit |
| Below 5 | Poor      | Regenerate      |

### Personalization Tips
